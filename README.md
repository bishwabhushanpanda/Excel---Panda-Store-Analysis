### Analysis on the Dataset:

•	Did **data cleaning** to remove duplicates and to make an age group column from Age.

•	Created **Pivot Charts**, **Graphs**, **Slicers** and **PivotTables** to summarize the data and visually get the information quickly.

•	Lastly built an **Interactive Dashboard** in excel with slicers so that users can interact with the dashboard and view it in different ways.

### Questions:

•	Compare the sales and order using single charts.

•	Which month got the highest sales and orders?

•	Who purchased more – Men or women in 2022?

•	What are different order status in 2022?

•	List top 7 states contributing the sales ?

•	Relationship between age and Gender based on number of orders.

•	Which channel is contributing to maximum sales?

•	What is the highest selling category? 

### Key Insight:

•	Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh are the top 3 states contributing sales( ~35%)
